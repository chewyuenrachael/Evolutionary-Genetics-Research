**Project title: **Distinguishing Introgression and Incomplete Lineage Sorting in Evolutionary Genetics Using Branch Lengths

**Abstract: **Accurately distinguishing between introgression and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) in evolutionary genetics is essential for reconstructing phylogenetic histories and understanding the mechanisms driving speciation and genetic diversity. Both introgression—the transfer of genetic material between species through hybridization and backcrossing—and ILS—the retention of ancestral polymorphisms leading to gene tree discordance—produce similar patterns of shared genetic diversity, posing significant analytical challenges.

My capstone project aims to evaluate and refine computational methods, specifically the D-statistic (ABBA-BABA test) and the QuIBL (Quantifying Introgression via Branch Lengths) method, to improve their efficacy in differentiating between introgression and ILS. By conducting simulation studies under various evolutionary scenarios—including rapid radiations, presence of recombination breakpoints, and varying levels of taxa divergence—and analyzing real genetic sequence data from public databases, I intend to identify the limitations of current methods and propose enhancements.

Furthermore, I will explore the application of these evolutionary genetics concepts to cancer research. Understanding the genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of tumor cell populations can provide critical insights into tumor heterogeneity and inform treatment strategies. By drawing parallels between species evolution and tumor evolution, this project seeks to bridge theoretical evolutionary genetics with practical biomedical applications, contributing valuable insights to both fields.
